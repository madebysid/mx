datasource db {

model Inbox {
	id String @id
}

// Next steps:
// 1. Add your DB connection string as the `url` of the `datasource` block
// 2. Run `prisma2 introspect` to get your data model into the schema (this will override this file and delete all comments!)
// 3. Run `prisma2 generate` to generate Prisma Client JS
// 4. Start using Prisma Client JS in your application
